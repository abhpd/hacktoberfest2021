# Simple Python3 program to multiply two polynomials
# A[] represents coefficients of first polynomial
# B[] represents coefficients of second polynomial
# m and n are sizes of A[] and B[] respectively

     # Multiply two polynomials term by term
     # Take ever term of first polynomial
    for i in range(m):
         # Multiply the current term of first 
        # polynomial with every term of 
        # second polynomial.
        for j in range(n):
            prod[i + j] += A[i] * B[j];
    return prod;
